# DMQC_status_and_statistics

## A. Script **get_DMQC_stats.m** <br />

This script computes DMQC statistics for a given list of floats <br />
<br />
**INPUTS**
 - **argo_profile_detailled_index.txt** and <br />
   **argo_synthetic-profile_detailled_index.txt** if i_BGC=1
 - **ar_greylist.txt**
 - **floats list**: csv file, separated by ";", with 4 fields:<br />
    WMO; COUNTRY; LAUNCH_DATE; PROGRAM<br />
        COUNTRY is the country in charge of the delayed mode processing (from OceanOPS)<br />
        LAUNCH_DATE must be in the format "YYYY/MM/DD".<br />
   e.g.:<br />
   WMO;COUNTRY;LAUNCH_DATE;PROGRAM<br />
   3901496;United Kingdom;2014/10/20;Argo UK Bio<br />
   3901497;United Kingdom;2014/10/24;Argo UK Bio<br />
   These 4 fields can be extracted from the OceanOPS website or directly downloaded from <br />
   https://www.ocean-ops.org/share/Argo/Status/<br />
   In the argo_all.csv from OceanOPS, the corresponding columns to account for are :<br />
         REF (-> WMO), COUNTRY , DEPL_DATE (-> LAUNCH_DATE) and PROGRAM 
 - **country_code.csv**: csv file, separated by ";", with 2 fields:<br />
    COUNTRY; COUNTRY_CODE<br />
       COUNTRY should follow the OceanOPS conventions<br />
       COUNTRY_CODE is a 3-digit CODE that will be used on graphs and outputs.<br />
    The default template country_code_template.csv from the script directory can be used.<br />
    This default contains all the countries associated to Argo in OceanOPS with the<br />
    corresponding OTAN (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NATO_country_codes) official <br />
    3-digits codes (list of relevant countries extracted the 2023/07/07 from OceanOPS database)<br />
<br />

 **CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS**
 - **i_descending_profile**: 1 means descending profiles are considered, <br />
                         0 means descending profiles are not considered.
 - **sage**: threshold (in days) for floats and observations statistics.
 - **i_bgc**: 1 means bgc profiles/parameters are considered (the detailed argo synthetic index will be <br />
            read for BGC parameters, the detailed argo index will be read for CTD)<br />
          0 means core information (CTD) is analysed from the detailed argo index.
 - **input_list_of_parameters_to_treat** is the list of parameters to analyse
 - **print_svg**: 1 means figures will be saved in .svg format as well<br />
 (interesting for high quality, but a little longer to save).
 - **output_graphs_per_float**: flag to indicate if graphs per float should be<br />
   recorded. (Graphs will be recorded by bunch of 40 floats max. For treatment with a large<br />
   number of floats, this may not be relevant)
 - **n_max_float_per_graph**: associated to output_graphs_per_float.
<br />

**OUTPUTS**
 - **Figures**   saved in folder outputs_yyyy-mm-dd/Plots 
 - **Analyses**  saved in folder outputs_yyyy-mm-dd/Syntheses 
 - **Copy of input files** saved in folder outputs_yyyy-mm-dd

 **Auxiliary functions needed**
    - read_csv 
    - get_data_from_index 
    - plotBarStackGroups 

 **WARNING** : Profile_QC for PRES information is not yet available. IndexData<br />
 is filled with qc="X" for the moment, and plots related to pres profile<br />
 qc are skipped.<br />

 **Version**: 3.1 (2023/07/12)<br />

 **Historic**:<br />
 - V1.0 : This script originally created by Andrea Garcia Juan and Romain<br />
        CancouÃ«t, and updated by Luca Arduini Plaisant.
 - V2.0 (2023/06/19): 
   - The script architecture was reviewed on 2023/06/19 by Delphine Dobler <br />
     to include the processing of BGC floats and to enhance performances.
 - V2.01 (2023/07/07): 
   - adding one test for the existence of found indices
   - only keep BGC parameters that were found in the synthetic index file
   - output an additional file with this information
 - V2.1  (2023/07/07): 
   - fetch DAC information from the index
   - record D-profile last update date in output
   - associate country_codes from a config file
   - add -f option to final zip to allow overwrite if script is<br />
        launched several times on the same day
 - V3.0  (2023/07/10):
   - merge CTD and BGC processings (no need for the user to know<br />
          which WMO is BGC, which one is not)
 - V3.1  (2023/07/12):
   - add plot with the number of R/A/D profiles per variable
   - add plots with information by cycle and by WMO:
     - R/A/D status
     - profile QC status
     - PSAL_adjustement<br />
     => These plots replace the old get_DMQC_adjustment.m script
   - stop duplicating graphs for CTD mode
   - skip plots with PRES profile_QC (information not yet available in index)

## C. TOOLBOX
Name & Description of the auxiliary functions:
- read_csv:	read a csv file and generates an struct with file variables	
- get_data_from_index: gets chosen variables from index file for a given list of floats
- plotBarStackGroups: Permit to make a bar plot with stacked bars for one graph tick.
